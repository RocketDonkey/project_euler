"""Project Euler - Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Proof that every number is = 4*(n-3) + (n-6):

E(n) = E(n-1) + E(n-2)
     = E(n-2) + E(n-3) + E(n-3) + E(n-4)
     = 3*E(n-3) + 2*E(n-4)
     = 3*E(n-3) + E(n-4) + E(n-5) + E(n-6)
     = 4*E(n-3) + E(n-6)

Looks like it can be used recursively but don't think it will save any time.
